# Welcome!

Welcome to the manual of the [BerkeleyGW code](https://berkeleygw.org), a
[free, open source](license.md), and massively parallel computational package for
electron excited-state properties that is based on the many-body perturbation
theory employing the *ab initio* GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation
methodology.

Use the menu on the left to navigate over the different components of the code,
or [click here to start with an overview](overview.md).

Make sure to also read other [documentation
resources](https://berkeleygw.org/documentation/) such as tutorial slides and
examples. If you still have questions that were not answered here, or if you
found a problem in the code, you can also send a question to the [BerkeleyGW
help forum](https://groups.google.com/a/berkeleygw.org/forum/#!forum/help).
