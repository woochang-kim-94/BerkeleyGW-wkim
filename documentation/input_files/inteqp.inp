# ### K-point interpolation scheme
#
#
# The interpolation algorithm is based on the Delaunay tessellation of the
# k-points. This guarantees that the interpolant is a continuous function, and
# that we are always interpolating, and never extrapolating. (default)
#delaunay_interpolation
# You can also use the previous interpolation method, which might give
# interpolants that are not continuous.
#greedy_interpolation


# ### K-point interpolation transformation
#
#
# Do a linear interpolation of the quasiparticle corrections over k. The
# band structure may acquire a spurious linear dispersion around band extrema
# instead of being parabolic. However, band structures will appear smoother
# when interpolated from a coarse k-point sampling.
#kpt_interpolation_linear
# Transform the quasiparticle corrections to an exponential form which
# preserves the quadratic dispersion around band extrema. This preserves
# the correct parabolic dispersion near the VBM/CBM, which the band structure
# appears wiggly when interpolated from a coarse k-point sampling. (default)
