# input option 'restrict_kpoints' reduces the sum over k-points

# Verbosity level, options are:
#
# - 1 = default
#
# - 2 = medium - info about k-points, symmetries, and eqp corrections.
#
# - 3 = high   - full dump of the reduced and unfolded k-points.
#
# - 4 = log    - log of various function calls. Use to debug code.
#
# - 5 = debug  - extra debug statements. Use to debug code.
#
# - 6 = max    - only use if instructed to, severe performance downgrade.
#
# Note that verbosity levels are cumulative. Most users will want to stick
# with level 1 and, at most, level 3. Only use level 4+ if debugging the code.

# ### K-point unfolding and symmetries
#
# These flags define whether to use symmetries to unfold
# the Brillouin zone or not in files. These flags should match the ones
# you used in [`absorption.inp`](absorption-keywords.md).

# See [`absorption.inp`](absorption-keywords.md#no_symmetries_fine_grid).

# Instead of calculating the exciton wavefunction on every real-space grid point, we can
# downsample the grid by the following factor (each number controls the 
# downsampling for the corresponding particular axis [x,y,z]). Note that the
# real-space grid is rounded up, so that there will be at least one point no
# matter now much you downsample it!
#downsample 2 2 2

# Only output the exciton wavefunction modulus squared. This makes the output file
# 2/3 smaller. *This option is mandatory if you want to integrate the result
# on a particular axis!*
#only_psi2

# Umcomment if you want to integrate the wavefunction modulus squared along
# one or two directions. No normalization is performed. You'll also have to
# enable the only_psi2 flag to use the following options.
#integrate_x
#integrate_y
#integrate_z

# Uncomment this option to bypass the extra checks that are performed when
# unfolding the BZ. This is usually safe to do if you are not unfolding the BZ.
#no_bz_check

# For spinor wavefunctions, you need to specify the desired spin polarization for
# the constituent hole and electron states.
# 1 is up, 2 is down.
# Use keyword spinor to activate spinor functionality

# ### Experimental features for testing purposes only
#
#
# 'unfolded BZ' is from the kpoints in the WFN file
# 'full BZ' is generated from the kgrid parameters in the WFN file
# See comments in Common/checkbz.f90 for more details
# Replace unfolded BZ with full BZ
#fullbz_replace
#
# Write unfolded BZ and full BZ to files
#fullbz_write
