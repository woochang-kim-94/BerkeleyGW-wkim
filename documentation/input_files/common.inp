# ### Truncation schemes for the Coulomb potential
#
# Since BerkerleyGW is a plane-wave-based code, one must
# truncate the Coulomb potential to avoid spurious interactions
# between repeated supercells when dealing with systems with reduced
# dimensionality. Make sure you understand how to setup your mean-field
# calculation so that the supercell is large enough to perform a
# truncation of the Coulomb potential.
#
#
# Truncate the Coulomb potential based on the Wigner-Seitz cell.
# This is the recommended truncation for 0D systems.
#cell_box_truncation
#
# Truncation scheme for 1D systems, such as carbon nanotubes. The
# $z$ direction is assumed to be periodic, and $x$ and $y$ confined.
#cell_wire_truncation
#
# Truncation scheme for 2D systems, such as graphene or monolayer
# MoS2. The $z$ direction is assumed to be confined, and $x$ and $y$
# periodic.
#cell_slab_truncation
#
# Truncate the Coulomb potential based on an analytical scheme.
# This is ok for quasi-spherical systems, such as CH4 molecule or C60,
# but the [[cell_box_truncation]] is the most general and recommended
# scheme. When using spherical truncation, you must also specify the
# radius for the truncation in [[spherical_truncation]].
#spherical_truncation
#
# This specifies the radius of for spherical truncation, in Bohr,
# so that the Coulomb potential $v(r)$ is zero for $r$ larger than
# these values. This flag is to be used together with [[spherical_truncation]].
#coulomb_truncation_radius   10.00


# Specify the Fermi level (in eV), if you want implicit doping
# Note that value refers to energies *after* scissor shift or eqp corrections.
# See also [[fermi_level_absolute]] and [[fermi_level_relative]] to control
# the meaning of the Fermi level.
#fermi_level             0.0

# The Fermi level in keyword [[fermi_level]] can be treated as an absolute
# value or relative to that found from the mean field (default)

#fermi_level_relative


# Read from traditional simple binary format for epsmat/eps0mat instead of HDF5 file format.
# Relevant only if code is compiled with HDF5 support.

# Verbosity level, options are:
#
# - 1: default
# - 2: medium - info about k-points, symmetries, and eqp corrections.
# - 3: high   - full dump of the reduced and unfolded k-points.
# - 4: log    - log of various function calls. Use to debug code.
# - 5: debug  - extra debug statements. Use to debug code.
# - 6: max    - only use if instructed to, severe performance downgrade.
# Note that verbosity levels are cumulative. Most users will want to stick
# with level 1 and, at most, level 3. Only use level 4+ if debugging the code.
