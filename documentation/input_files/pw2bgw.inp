! Converts the output files produced by pw.x to the input files for BerkeleyGW.
! Note that `pw2bgw.x` is also distributed and automatically compiled within !
! the Quantum ESPRESSO package, it cannot be compiled in the BerkeleyGW code
! alone
!
! You cannot use USPP, PAW, or spinors in a pw.x run for BerkeleyGW.
!
! You cannot use "K_POINTS gamma" in a pw.x run for BerkeleyGW.
! Use "K_POINTS { tpiba | automatic | crystal }" even for the
! Gamma-point calculation.
!
! It is recommended to run a pw.x "bands" calculation with "K_POINTS crystal"
! and a list of k-points produced by kgrid.x, which is a part of BerkeleyGW
! package (see BerkeleyGW documentation for details).
!
! You can also run a pw.x "nscf" calculation instead of "bands", but in this
! case pw.x may generate more k-points than provided in the input file of pw.x.
! If this is the case for your calculation you will get errors in BerkeleyGW.
!
! Examples showing how to run BerkeleyGW on top of Quantum ESPRESSO including
! the input files for pw.x and pw2bgw.x are distributed together with the
! BerkeleyGW package.
