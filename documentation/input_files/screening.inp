# ### Screening type
# How does the screening of the system behaves? (default=[[screening_semiconductor]])
# BerkeleyGW uses this information to apply a different numerical
# procedure to computing the diverging $q\rightarrow 0$ contribution
# to the screened Coulomb potential $W_{GG'}(q)$.
# These models are not used in Hartree-Fock calculations.
#
#
# Use this flag on gapped system (**default**).
#screening_semiconductor
#
# Use this flag on metallic system, i.e., constant DOS at the Fermi energy.
#screening_metal
#
# Use this flag on systems with vanishing linear DOS at the Fermi level, such
# as graphene.
#screening_graphene
