# ### Scissors operator
# Scissors operator (linear fit of the quasiparticle
# energy corrections) for the bands in `WFN` and `WFNq`.
# For valence-band energies:
#
# - `ev_cor = ev_in + evs + evdel * (ev_in - ev0)`
#
# For conduction-band energies:
#
# - `ec_cor = ec_in + ecs + ecdel * (ec_in - ec0)`
#
# Defaults is zero for all entries, i.e., no scissors corrections.
# `evs`, `ev0`, `ecs`, `ec0` are in eV.
# If you have `eqp.dat` and `eqp_q.dat` files
# this information is ignored in favor of the eigenvalues
# in eqp.dat and eqp_q.dat.
# One can specify all parameters for scissors operator
# in a single line with `cvfit evs ev0 evdel ecs ec0 ecdel`
