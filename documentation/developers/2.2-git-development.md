# Git development cycle

This pages gives you instructions how to use git with the BerkeleyGW
repository. This guide is intended both for people novice and experienced with
git.


## 0. Configuration

First, make sure you followed the steps in `2.1-git_setup.md` to setup git
and BerkeleyGW.


## 1. About git

Git is simply a fancy way to manipulate a graph. You should really have this idea very
clear that there is no "special branch", like what happens in SVN. Also, familiarize
yourself with the basic git commands. A few handy tutorials follow below:

- [Github git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Github git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
- [Git interactive playground](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
- [Visual git guide](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)

## 2. Philosophy and organization

The philosophy we adopt for the BerkeleyGW git development is that all work should
be done in repositories forked from `BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW`, and all changes proposed
by users should be incorporated as pull requests (PRs). PRs are simply a request for
the maintainer of the main BerkeleyGW repository to incorporate changes introduced
by developers. These changes are in turn simply one or more commits stored in a
personal branch.

In addition to the local machine where the development is taking place, each user
should have their git account configured so that it is aware of two remote locations
for the BerkeleyGW source code:

- `upstream`: This is the remote repository hosted on github under the `BerkeleyGW`
  organization account, on `github.com:BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW.git`.
  This is the repository from which all developers should base their development.
- `origin`: This is the remote repository hosted on github for each developer, and
  forked from the main BerkeleyGW repository. For instance, the `origin` for a user
  `USERNAME` is stored on `github.com:USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git`, under `USERNAME`'s
  personal account.

Both `upstream` and `origin` remotes may have an arbitrary number of branches, but
all the development should be made in a `master` branch. The following are the minimum
number of branches that developers should be aware of:

- `upstream/master`: This is the main development branch of BerkeleyGW, which has
  the most stable and up-to-date version of the code. This is roughly equivalent
  to the `trunk` branch that we had in our SVN server, except that `upstream/master`
  is expected always to be stable (or mostly stable). This is before we run the
  testsuite before introducing any change to `upstream/master` via a PR.
  We also aim at making the code history of `upstream/master` as clean and as easy to
  understand as possible, and thus we have some rules on how PRs should be structured.
- `origin/master`: This is the main development branch that each developer has in their
  personal github account. This branch should be constantly synchronized with
  `upstream/master` to avoid conflicts. Each developer should also put their changes in
  this branch before it can be incorporated into `upstream/master` via a PR.
- local `master` branch: This is the local branch in the workstation of the developer or
  in a cluster/supercomputer/etc. So, there may be a number of local `master` branches, but
  they are not expected to directly communicate with each other. The local
  `master` branch is where users should put either their main code development, or at
   least the code development they eventually want to push to `origin/master` to be
   incorporated into `upstream/master` via a PR.

We understand that git is an extremely powerful tool, which is both great for
experienced developers, but which can also daunting for the less experienced ones. We
therefore allow experienced developers to use whichever workflow model they would
like internally for their development, as long as some rules are respected, while
also creating a set of command aliases to simplify daily code development and
remove friction to use git. At the same time, the system of pull requests should
minimize the need of active maintenance on `upstream/master` apart from brief audits,
since it is the responsibility of each user to ensure that their code can be
incorporated into `upstream/master`.

Finally, even for less experienced developers, we believe that our transition from SVN
to git should be a simple process that will give tangible benefits such as the
possibility of "checkpointing" a more complicated code development enterprise
using local commits.


## 3. Rules for BerkeleyGW development

### Rules:
1. **We only accept contributions in the form of pull requests (PRs). No exceptions.**
   This is important because the buildbot gets triggered during the PR, so we know
   whether a particular change breaks the testsuite even before incorporating it
   into `upstream/master`.

2. **Developers must not submit more than one PR at the same time.**
   Failure to do so will put unnecessary stress into the buildbot server.
   Developers must also actively monitor if there are other PRs being reviewed and
   that take precedence, and communicate in the appropriate channels (eg: Slack).

3. **We only accept PRs from branches that are ahead (but not behind)
   `upstream/master`,**
   i.e., we only accept PRs that can be resolved as a fast-forward.
   For most commits, we won't accept pull requests that require non-ff merges,
   as we strive to keep the history of `upstream/master` as clean as possible.

4. **Developers must keep their `origin/master` branch in sync with the
   `upstream/master` branch.**
   Failure do to so will dramatically increase the changes of conflicts.

5. **Commit messages must follow the standard structure recommended for git:**
   ```
   Short (50 character or less) summary of changes

   More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
   characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
   subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
   line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
   the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
   two together.

   Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

     - Bullet points are okay, too

     - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
       single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
   ```
   The summary should be in the imperative form (eg: "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
   More details [here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).

Note that the aliases installed in the
[Git setup](https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW/wiki/Git-setup)
procedure will automatically take care of rules 3-4!

### Additional policies that are strongly suggested:

1. **Developers should send pull requests on small and atomic changes**.
   Developers are encouraged to send PRs soon and often, such
   as when they implement part of a larger feature, improved documentation,
   or a bug fix. However, try as much as possible to break up large commits
   into atomic changes on a specific. For instance, don't include both
   a bug fix and a new feature in a PR, break them into two. Also, perform
   even more atomic tasks in your commits. For instance, don't improve the
   documentation in the same commit as you add a new routine to the code.
   While it is ok to do both activities in the same PR, they should be broken
   into several commits.

2. **Developers should squash small commits such as checkpoints and fixes
   before sending PRs.**
   Git allows you to perform an arbitrary number of local commits, which is
   great for checkpointing larger developments. At the same time as we want
   the commits in a PR to be atomic, very small commits often don't make much
   sense in the big picture and make debugging harder. For instance, if you
   performed three commits where you simply fixed typos, you can combine
   ("squash") them together. Similarly, if you performed a number of commits
   because you found bugs in your implementation, you can combine some of these
   commits together into a single commit that is correct. We include some
   utilities to simplify this process.


## 3. Recommended BerkeleyGW git development workflow

The recommended approach for BerkeleyGW development with git is to perform
all work on the local `master` branch and use the provided alias `git sync`
to simplify pull and push operations. This is likely the simplest workflow for
most developers, in particular those who are not interested in using more
advanced branch features from git, as it provides an experience similar to SVN.
Advanced git users may use their preferred development workflow, as long as they
follow the rules above.

The recommended BerkeleyGW git development workflow is the following:

1. Synchronize your branch
   ```bash
   git sync
   ```

2. Code.
   ```bash
   vi Common/gmap.f90 # Not really!
   ```

3. Commit your changes. You should commit as often as you would like,
   since these commits are still local at this point, unlike what happens in SVN.
   ```bash
   git status # Show which files were modified/added/removed
   git add <files you changed>
   git commit # Check the guidelines for commit messages.
   ```

4. Repeat steps (2-3).

5. Whenever you wish to send a PR or need to update your local code base because there
   where changes in `upstream/master`, you need to use the `git sync` command:
   ```bash
   git sync
   ```
   If you are more experienced with git, you may also pass the "-i" argument: this will tell
   `sync` to perform an interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   # Run the following command only if you are interested in keeping a copy
   # of the previous unsquashed commits for historical reasons:
   # git branch -b backup

   # Tell git sync to perform an interactive rebase:
   git sync -i
   ```
   Interactive rebases give you the opportunity to combine (squash) several commits
   to make the history tidier. Squashing commits can also help resolve some conflicts
   before the rebase operation.

6. After you are done, create a PR:
   - Go to website for your private fork of the BerkeleyGW repository
     (`https://github.com/USERNAME/BerkeleyGW`)
   - Click on the "Pull requests", then on "New pull request"
   - Make sure "base fork" is "BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW" and "head fork" is
     "USERNAME/BerkeleyGW"
   - You should see a message "Able to merge"; then click on "Create pull request".


## 4. Under the hood: what is `git sync`?

`git pull` is the main command of our recommended git workflow.
It is an alias that performs three things:
1. *Fetches* and *rebases* any changes from `origin/master` to your local `master` branch.
2. *Fetches* and *rebases* any changes from `upstream/master` to your local `master` branch.
3. *Pushes* your local `master` branch to `origin/master`.

What does all this mean?
- The *fetch* operation simply downloads a remote branch (eg: `upstream/master`)
  and stores it locally.
- The *rebase* operation takes a remote branch (eg: `upstream/master`), figures out
  where it diverged from your local `master` branch, and rewrites your local `master`
  branch so that your previous changes that you wrote to your `master` branch will
  appear *after* the most up-do-date state of `upstream/master`. This can be visualized
  in the following diagram:
  ```
  Before rebase:
                     A---B master
                    /
               C---D---E upstream/master

  After rebase:
                         A'--B' master
                        /
               C---D---E upstream/master
  ```
  This is similar how the `svn update` command works, except that there are no
  "local commits" in SVN, just changes in the local directory that were not committed.
- The *push* command simply saves your local `master` branch to your private branch
  `origin/master` stored on :

You may be asking yourself: why do we need to fetch and rebase from `origin/master`, since
this is your private branch and will always be in sync with your local `master` branch? The
answer is that you may be doing development on different machines, so your local `master` branch
may be different in each one of them!


## 4. When things go wrong

Complications can arise when you perform the `sync` operation to update
your local `master` branch with respect to `upstream/master`, as often happens
when there is a conflict. This is not a complication of git per se, as this is a
problem that also happens in SVN when you try to update your local directory
that has uncommitted changes. On the contrary, git should make it easier for you
to fix these conflicts, since your local changes should have been committed to
your local `master` branch, and so it is virtually impossible to lose them!

Resolving conflicts depends on their nature; however, there are some general
strategies that are valid for any conflict:

- If there is a conflict, type `git status` to see which files need your attention.
  If you manage to fix them, type `git add <files-that-you-fixed>`, followed by
  `git rebase --continue` (if you are using the `git sync` command). You may need
  to repeat this process until you get rid of all conflicts introduced by all commits.
- If you would like to go back to the previous state, just type `git rebase --abort`.
  Your local `master` branch should go back to its previous state. At any time,
  you can also access the state of your previous `master` branch by accessing the
  `before-rebase` branch.
- If you can't figure out how to fix the problem, or if you want to simplify the
  conflict resolution, you may want to considering squashing your commits. The idea
  is that, instead of resolving the conflict introduced by each of your commits,
  you can combine them all together, and resolve the conflict of the new, combined
  commit. You can do that by using the `git sync -i` command. When an editor pops up,
  mark all but the first commit with an `s`, which stands for "squash". Note that you
  will need to first type `git rebase --abort` before you can do `git sync -i` if you
  where in the middle of a rebase operation.
