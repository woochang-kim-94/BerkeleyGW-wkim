# Git setup

This page is intended for developers wanting to contribute to the main BerkeleyGW
repository using git. It offers a step-by-step guide for setting up your git
environment and pushing your contributions.


## 0. Basic Git and Github set up

First, let's set up your account on github. Make sure you:

1. Have an account on github:
   If you still don't have it, [sign up for a free personal account](https://github.com/).

2. Are part of the BerkeleyGW organization on github:
   If you are still not a member, contact one of the administrators of the present page,
   such as Jack Deslippe (jdeslip), Felipe Jornada (jornada), or Gabriel Antonius (GkAntonius).
   Only members can view the [BerkeleyGW repository](https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW).

Next, follow the github online documentation on how to
[set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).
Make sure you follow the instructions to:

1. Have a working version of Git, or [download one](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if necessary.
2. Set your [Git username](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git)
   and [commit email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git).
   For example:
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Steven G. Louie"
   git config --global user.email "sglouie@berkeley.edu"
   ```
   Make sure you use the same names/emails on all your workstations/clusters!

You may also want to change the default editor, if you are not familiar with `vim`.
E few common choices:
```
git config --global core.editor "vim" # This is the default
git config --global core.editor "emacs"
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

We [recommend](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/)
you use HTTPS URLs to interact with the github servers because it doesn't require
any setup. However, you may also setup authentication using SSH, in
particular if want to easy solution for secure and passwordless connections.
If you would like to use SSH for authentication, checkout out
[these instructions]([https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/]).

If you are completely new to git and github, we recommend that you also look at the
basic tutorials, such as [hello world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).


## 1. Fork and download the main (`upstream`) repository

Once you are signed in on github, visit the [BerkeleyGW](https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW)
page and hit the 'Fork' button on the upper right region of the page,
then select your own account as the forking location.

Then, open a terminal on the machine where you wish to perform your git development,
go to the location that will contain the main BerkeleyGW directory, and run the command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git
```
if you used the simpler HTTPS authentication, or
```shell
git clone  git@github.com:USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git
```
if you opted for SSH authentication.

Here, `USERNAME` should be replaced by your github user name. The full address
that you need here can be seen by hitting the 'Clone or Download' button
on the github page of *your own fork* of the project. Make sure you select either the
HTTPS or GIT address, depending on your setup.

The `git clone` command will create a directory named `BerkeleyGW` and download
the main distribution therein. You can specify a different name for this
directory as an optional argument.


## 2. Configure repository

Descend into the directory created by the previous step, and type the
following command:
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerkeleyGW/git-config/master/setup.sh | sh
```

You should get the following message:
```
Configured upstream with XXX URL.
Configuration script successfully (re)installed.
```
where XXX is SSH or HTTPS.

This will install the `git update-config` command, which can automatically download
the configuration file for this repository, along with some git aliases to make our
life easier. We will get into these aliases that later on. You may also need to
update the configuration scripts in the future, which can be done by running
`git update-config` any time in the future.

If you are experienced with Git, take a look at the `.git/bgw-config` file
that was created, and at `.git/config`.


## 3.  Verify your configuration

You can list the locations known by this git repository with the command
```
git remote -v
```

You should see the output
```
origin	https://github.com/USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW.git (push)
```
if you configured the URLs with HTTPS, or
```
origin	git@github.com:USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:USERNAME/BerkeleyGW.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW.git (push)
```
if you configured with SSH.

Also, type `git lg`. You should see a colorful log with the recent commits.

Finally, type `git sync`. You should see an output of this sort:
```
Current branch master is up to date.
Success: fetched origin/master and rebased master to origin/master.
From github.com:BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
 * [new branch]      stable     -> upstream/stable
Current branch master is up to date.
Success: fetched upstream/master and rebased master to upstream/master.
Everything up-to-date
```
