To activate debugging features uncomment the following flag in the arch.mk file:

    DEBUGFLAG = -DDEBUG -DVERBOSE


For exuberant debuggig, see module push_pop_m in file: Common/push_pop.f90
and edit the line:

    integer, private            :: debug_level = 0                               

with meaning:

    0: no debugging trace
    1: only node 0 writes trace
    2: all nodes write trace. Very slow.         


Recompile the code to activate debug features.
