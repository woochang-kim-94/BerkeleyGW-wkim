Wannier90 UNK file to BerkeleyGW WFN file converter
Author: Zhenglu Li, 2022

Functions:
1) Convert Wannier90 preprocessing UNK files to BGW WFN. This allows
   BerkeleyGW interfaces with ALL DFT codes which have interface to Wannier90

2) Convert Wannier90-interpolated wavefunctions on arbitrary k-grids (patched,
   high-symmetry lines, non-uniform, extremely fine, grids) to BGW WFN.

   This funciton requires a modified version of Wannier90 to print out UWK files
   with diagonalization coefficients. Gauge is consistent between W90 and BGW.

   UWK file is the periodic part of Wannier-Bloch basis function on real-space FFT
   grids.  This file can be obtained by modifications of Wannier90. 

   Contact Zhenglu Li for the modified version of Wannier90 (lzlwell@berkeley.edu).

3) Based on 2), with the modified version of Wannier90, one can use the outputs to 
   modify EPW code. Therefore, EPW and BGW can use EXACTLY THE SAME interpolated
   wavefunctions. This is useful since the interpolated electron-phonon matrix elements
   from EPW and the interpolated BSE kernel matrix elements are in the SAME GAUGE.
   This is critical for a number of calculations where the scattering amplitudes 
   can be directly added together from different physical processes (e-ph, e-h).
