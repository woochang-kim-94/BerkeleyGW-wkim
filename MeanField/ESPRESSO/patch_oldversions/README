espresso buglist:

(1) <<< THIS IS FIXED IN QUANTUM ESPRESSO 5.0 >>>
If you run espresso nscf calculation with startingwfc set to file 
you may get error message saying "cannot read wfc : file not found". 
This happens because subroutine verify_tmpdir in PW/input.f90 renames 
data-file.xml to data-file.xml.bck and subroutines read_planewaves and 
read_wavefunctions in PW/pw_restart.f90 try to read from data-file.xml 
which doesn't exist. To get around this problem read from .xml.bck in 
read_planewaves and read_wavefunctions if opening .xml returns error.

(2) <<< THIS IS FIXED IN QUANTUM ESPRESSO 5.0 >>>
Missing "CALL stop_pp ( )" at the end of PP/plan_avg.f90 causes it 
to crash sometimes.
