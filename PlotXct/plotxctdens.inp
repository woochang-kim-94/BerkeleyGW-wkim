# input option 'restrict_kpoints' reduces the sum over k-points
# above to a sum over the specified number that give most of the contribution
# to the norm of eigenvectors. This is handy if there are many k-points
# but only a few of them give sizable contribution.
# this definitely only works for 1 state at a time right now, and it needs
# to be tested if this will be workable for excited stated densities at all.
#restrict_kpoints 5

# Verbosity level, options are:
# 1 = default
# 2 = medium - info about k-points, symmetries, and eqp corrections.
# 3 = high   - full dump of the reduced and unfolded k-points.
# 4 = log    - log of various function calls. Use to debug code.
# 5 = debug  - extra debug statements. Use to debug code.
# 6 = max    - only use if instructed to, severe performance downgrade.
# Note that verbosity levels are cumulative. Most users will want to stick
# with level 1 and, at most, level 3. Only use level 4+ if debugging the code.

# EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY
# 'unfolded BZ' is from the kpoints in the WFN file
# 'full BZ' is generated from the kgrid parameters in the WFN file
# See comments in Common/checkbz.f90 for more details
# Replace unfolded BZ with full BZ
#fullbz_replace
# Write unfolded BZ and full BZ to files
#fullbz_write

#BEGIN_INTERNAL_ONLY

# The following flags control whether the fine/q-shifted grids must be unfolded
# with the symmetry operations. You should use the same flags from your
# absorption calculation.

# Use symmetries to unfold fine grid?
#no_symmetries_fine_grid
#use_symmetries_fine_grid

# Use symmetries to unfold q-shifted grid?
#no_symmetries_shifted_grid
#use_symmetries_shifted_grid

# Uncomment this option to bypass the extra checks that are performed when
# unfolding the BZ. This is usually safe to do if you are not unfolding the BZ.
#no_bz_check
